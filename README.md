This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

- [done] https://github.com/gitsumitsingh/Nextjs_Assignment4.0

- Attach screen shots of an output/ console which shows particular component rendered at client side / server side / static in resources folder with names CSROutput, SSROutput etc.
- [done] /public/resources

- 2. When to use what? Explain which component should be rendered at client side, server side or static .dynamic? share what are the different use cases for these selections?
- [done] As per my knowledge, we should use Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for speed and search engine visibility, Client-Side Rendering (CSR) for interaction, Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for balance, or Static Site Generation (SSG) for fast performance
